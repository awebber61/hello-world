         <center><div class="polaroid"><h2 class="h2"><center>Sonnet 8</center></h2><p class="p">Set me where as the sun doth parch the green,<br/>
Or where his beams do not dissolve the ice; <br/>
In temperate heat where he is felt and seen;<br/>
With proud people, in presence sad and wise; <br/>
Set me in base, or yet in high degree, <br/>
In the long night, or in the shortest day, <br/>
In clear weather, or where mists thickest be, <br/>
In lost youth, or when my hairs be grey; <br/>
Set me in earth, in heaven, or yet in hell,<br/> 
In hill, in dale, or in the foaming flood; <br/>
Thrall, or at large, alive where so I dwell,<br/> 
Sick, or in health, in ill fame or good: <br/>
Yours will I be, and with that only thought <br/>
Comfort myself when that my hope is nought.</p><br/> <br/>– Henry Howard</div><br/><br/>
             <div class="polaroid1"><h2> <center>Sonnett 33</center></h2>
                         <p>Full many a glorious morning have I seen<br/>
Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,<br/>
Kissing with golden face the meadows green,<br/>
Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;<br/>
Anon permit the basest clouds to ride<br/>
With ugly rack on his celestial face,<br/>
And from the forlorn world his visage hide,<br/>
Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:<br/>
Even so my sun one early morn did shine,<br/>
With all triumphant splendour on my brow;<br/>
But out, alack, he was but one hour mine,<br/>
The region cloud hath mask’d him from me now.<br/>
Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;<br/>
Suns of the world may stain when heaven’s sun staineth.<br/>
        <br/>– William Shakespere</p></div><br/><br/>
             <div class="polaroid2"><h2><center>The Sun Rising</center> </h2> <p>Busy old fool, unruly sun,<br/>
Why dost thou thus,<br/>
Through windows, and through curtains call on us?<br/>
Must to thy motions lovers’ seasons run?<br/>
Saucy pedantic wretch, go chide<br/>
Late school boys and sour prentices,<br/>
Go tell court huntsmen that the king will ride,<br/>
Call country ants to harvest offices,<br/>
Love, all alike, no season knows nor clime,<br/>
Nor hours, days, months, which are the rags of time.<br/>
<br/>
Thy beams, so reverend and strong<br/>
Why shouldst thou think?<br/>
I could eclipse and cloud them with a wink,<br/>
But that I would not lose her sight so long;<br/>
If her eyes have not blinded thine,<br/>
Look, and tomorrow late, tell me,<br/>
Whether both th’ Indias of spice and mine<br/>
Be where thou leftst them, or lie here with me.<br/>
Ask for those kings whom thou saw’st yesterday,<br/>
And thou shalt hear, All here in one bed lay.<br/>

<br/>
She’s all states, and all princes, I,<br/>
Nothing else is.<br/>
Princes do but play us; compared to this,<br/>
All honor’s mimic, all wealth alchemy.<br/>
Thou, sun, art half as happy as we,<br/>
In that the world’s contracted thus.<br/>
Thine age asks ease, and since thy duties be<br/>
To warm the world, that’s done in warming us.<br/>
Shine here to us, and thou art everywhere;<br/>
                 This bed thy center is, these walls, thy sphere.<br/><br/>- John Donne</p></div><br/><br/>
