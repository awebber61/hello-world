        <p class="p">Set me where as the sun doth parch the green,<br />
          Or where his beams do not dissolve the ice; <br />
          In temperate heat where he is felt and seen;<br />
          With proud people, in presence sad and wise; <br />
          Set me in base, or yet in high degree, <br />
          In the long night, or in the shortest day, <br />
          In clear weather, or where mists thickest be, <br />
          In lost youth, or when my hairs be grey; <br />
          Set me in earth, in heaven, or yet in hell,<br />
          In hill, in dale, or in the foaming flood; <br />
          Thrall, or at large, alive where so I dwell,<br />
          Sick, or in health, in ill fame or good: <br />
          Yours will I be, and with that only thought <br />
          Comfort myself when that my hope is nought.</p><br /> <br />– Henry Howard

        </h2>
        <p>Full many a glorious morning have I seen<br />
          Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,<br />
          Kissing with golden face the meadows green,<br />
          Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;<br />
          Anon permit the basest clouds to ride<br />
          With ugly rack on his celestial face,<br />
          And from the forlorn world his visage hide,<br />
          Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:<br />
          Even so my sun one early morn did shine,<br />
          With all triumphant splendour on my brow;<br />
          But out, alack, he was but one hour mine,<br />
          The region cloud hath mask’d him from me now.<br />
          Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;<br />
          Suns of the world may stain when heaven’s sun staineth.<br />
          <br />– William Shakespere</p>

        </h2>
        <p>Busy old fool, unruly sun,<br />
          Why dost thou thus,<br />
          Through windows, and through curtains call on us?<br />
          Must to thy motions lovers’ seasons run?<br />
          Saucy pedantic wretch, go chide<br />
          Late school boys and sour prentices,<br />
          Go tell court huntsmen that the king will ride,<br />
          Call country ants to harvest offices,<br />
          Love, all alike, no season knows nor clime,<br />
          Nor hours, days, months, which are the rags of time.<br />
          <br />
          Thy beams, so reverend and strong<br />
          Why shouldst thou think?<br />
          I could eclipse and cloud them with a wink,<br />
          But that I would not lose her sight so long;<br />
          If her eyes have not blinded thine,<br />
          Look, and tomorrow late, tell me,<br />
          Whether both th’ Indias of spice and mine<br />
          Be where thou leftst them, or lie here with me.<br />
          Ask for those kings whom thou saw’st yesterday,<br />
          And thou shalt hear, All here in one bed lay.<br />

          <br />
          She’s all states, and all princes, I,<br />
          Nothing else is.<br />
          Princes do but play us; compared to this,<br />
          All honor’s mimic, all wealth alchemy.<br />
          Thou, sun, art half as happy as we,<br />
          In that the world’s contracted thus.<br />
          Thine age asks ease, and since thy duties be<br />
          To warm the world, that’s done in warming us.<br />
          Shine here to us, and thou art everywhere;<br />
          This bed thy center is, these walls, thy sphere.<br /><br />- John Donne</p>
