          Lost in Prayer
        </h2>
        <p class="p">Lately I’ve been calling on the Saint of Lost Causes.<br />
          Living through touch, I’ve been kissing his feet, <br />
          And letting my salt burn into the floor.<br />
          But long pauses still fill my prayers. <br /><br />
          I’ve been slowly drowning,<br />
          For forty days, My body<br />
          Wracked numb from pain. <br />
          And the black noise, it trembles.<br /><br />
          I long for the blows of daily life,<br />
          To strike the match, and let it burn. <br />
          To return me to that rocking feeling,<br />
          That never-ending wave,<br />
          That carries me back home.<br /><br />
          I’ve been trying to remember how the sun sets;<br />
          How the sky sparks into flames.<br />
          The clouds becoming the tinder,<br />
          That rest upon the spinning earth,<br />
          Where sunset never ends.<br /><br />

          Lost in a tidal wave, I seek refuge.<br />
          I pray to a God. But,<br />
          Why need God, when there is good?<br />
          Can’t I see, the extra letter,<br />
          Makes the invisible, tangible.<br /><br />

          When I am starved of hope,<br />
          My body turned cold,<br />
          And my tank on empty.<br />
          How the untended fire<br />
          Still burns, I do not know.</p><br /> <br />– Henry Howard

          Sonnett 33
        </h2>
        <p>Full many a glorious morning have I seen<br />
          Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,<br />
          Kissing with golden face the meadows green,<br />
          Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;<br />
          Anon permit the basest clouds to ride<br />
          With ugly rack on his celestial face,<br />
          And from the forlorn world his visage hide,<br />
          Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:<br />
          Even so my sun one early morn did shine,<br />
          With all triumphant splendour on my brow;<br />
          But out, alack, he was but one hour mine,<br />
          The region cloud hath mask’d him from me now.<br />
          Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;<br />
          Suns of the world may stain when heaven’s sun staineth.<br />
          <br />– William Shakespere</p>

          The Sun Rising
        </h2>
        <p>Busy old fool, unruly sun,<br />
          Why dost thou thus,<br />
          Through windows, and through curtains call on us?<br />
          Must to thy motions lovers’ seasons run?<br />
          Saucy pedantic wretch, go chide<br />
          Late school boys and sour prentices,<br />
          Go tell court huntsmen that the king will ride,<br />
          Call country ants to harvest offices,<br />
          Love, all alike, no season knows nor clime,<br />
          Nor hours, days, months, which are the rags of time.<br />
          <br />
          Thy beams, so reverend and strong<br />
          Why shouldst thou think?<br />
          I could eclipse and cloud them with a wink,<br />
          But that I would not lose her sight so long;<br />
          If her eyes have not blinded thine,<br />
          Look, and tomorrow late, tell me,<br />
          Whether both th’ Indias of spice and mine<br />
          Be where thou leftst them, or lie here with me.<br />
          Ask for those kings whom thou saw’st yesterday,<br />
          And thou shalt hear, All here in one bed lay.<br />

          <br />
          She’s all states, and all princes, I,<br />
          Nothing else is.<br />
          Princes do but play us; compared to this,<br />
          All honor’s mimic, all wealth alchemy.<br />
          Thou, sun, art half as happy as we,<br />
          In that the world’s contracted thus.<br />
          Thine age asks ease, and since thy duties be<br />
          To warm the world, that’s done in warming us.<br />
          Shine here to us, and thou art everywhere;<br />
          This bed thy center is, these walls, thy sphere.<br /><br />- John Donne</p>
