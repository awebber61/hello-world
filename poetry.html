          Lost in Prayer
        </h2>
        <p class="p">Lately I’ve been calling on the Saint of Lost Causes.<br />
          Living through touch, I’ve been kissing his feet, <br />
          And letting my salt burn into the floor.<br />
          But long pauses still fill my prayers. <br /><br />
          I’ve been slowly drowning,<br />
          For forty days, My body<br />
          Wracked numb from pain. <br />
          And the black noise, it trembles.<br /><br />
          I long for the blows of daily life,<br />
          To strike the match, and let it burn. <br />
          To return me to that rocking feeling,<br />
          That never-ending wave,<br />
          That carries me back home.<br /><br />
          I’ve been trying to remember how the sun sets;<br />
          How the sky sparks into flames.<br />
          The clouds becoming the tinder,<br />
          That rest upon the spinning earth,<br />
          Where sunset never ends.<br /><br />

          Lost in a tidal wave, I seek refuge.<br />
          I pray to a God. But,<br />
          Why need God, when there is good?<br />
          Can’t I see, the extra letter,<br />
          Makes the invisible, tangible.<br /><br />

          When I am starved of hope,<br />
          My body turned cold,<br />
          And my tank on empty.<br />
          How the untended fire<br />
          Still burns, I do not know.</p><br /> <br />– Annie Webber

          Thus passes the glory of the world
        </h2>
        <p>Let’s just sit here, feel lousy<br />
          And watch the grass grow.<br />
          Let’s stop the grinding sound<br />
          Our bones create when we move.<br /><br />
           
          Fetch me that dusty checkered blanket,<br />
          Let’s eat buttered toast with jam jars of scotch.  <br />
          Or let’s run through the meadow, laughing,<br />
          Till its set aflame by the setting sun.<br /><br />
           
          Let’s return to the warmth,<br />
          With a dance around the stove,<br />
          To The Mamas and the Papas, drumming<br />
          On skillets with slotted spoons.<br /><br />
           
          Let’s avoid the time before sleep,<br />
          When daily distractions flicker out<br />
          like fireflies fleeing fast<br />
          from lights touch.<br />
           
          Let’s stop the lion’s roar,<br />
          That shreds our stomachs.​<br />
          And the oil spill of regret, that slowly<br />
          Poisons the little creature inside.<br /><br />
           
          Let’s dream of someone else,<br />
          Who’s shape the bed truly holds,<br />
          But, for now, we can cling<br />
          To each other, to just breathe.<br /><br />

          The Sun Rising
        </h2>
        <p>After you mix two souls,<br />
          Combine the brightest blues<br />
          With the deepest reds<br />
          It becomes heavy.<br /><br />
          
          When you get up and leave,<br />
          Can you tell which bits are yours,<br />
          And which are theirs?<br />
          Is it possible to be untangled, or<br /><br />
           
          Do you leave holding pieces that don't match?<br />
          Left with gaps that feel hollow,<br />
          Can you get them back?<br />
          Can you grow anew?<br />
          
          It seems as though,<br />
          When you walk away from love,<br />
          You’ll always be carrying too little,<br />
          Or a little too much.<br /><br />- John Donne</p>
